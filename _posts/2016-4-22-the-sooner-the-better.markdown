Hopefully you've read my article regarding what I think about the phrase ASAP, if not [get caught up first](http://www.jefferydurand.com/leadership/management/philosophy/2015/12/16/asap-is-toxic-avoid-it-as-soon-as-possible.html).

*warning what follows is another rant*

Recently, I received a request for help from a co-worker. We were talking about a task that was blocking for another employee, meaning another employee would be somewhat useless for a couple hours until I had completed the task being asked of me.  With regard to the task assignment, everything seemed to be going well. I was asked to do a task, I responded saying it would be the first thing I'd get done after lunch.  I thought the conversation was over.  Then I received the dreaded follow up.  *"I can't really get my work done until this task is complete, so the sooner the better"*

*ughhhhhh* I thought but then replied, "okay" (cause I'm only a dickhead 95% of the time).

## The problem as I see it
It's my opinion that the phrase "the sooner the better" is just as bad and in many ways worse than ASAP.  I call it the passive aggressive version of ASAP.  It means the same as ASAP, but it's meant to be a friendlier nudge.  I imagine the person saying it with a smile, not realizing what an insult to the receivers intelligence it is.  Let's pick apart the phase a bit to try to understand why it's a terrible one to use and why it won't help you further your agenda.

First the "The sooner" part.  In most businesses "The Sooner" you can do something productive the better it is.  You'll never hear anyone say the longer it takes you to type up that document the better.  Thus, it is obvious that sooner is better when talking about the productivity of a worker.  Thus, in this case sooner is always equal to better or (sooner = better).  Since sooner = better, if you substitute sooner with better you get the phrase.  *"The better the better"*.  Most people can quickly see how this phrase is completely useless in any context.  

If you were to say "the better the better" to someone after they requested you do something they would  probably think about ignoring your request altogether.  Which get's me back to the point.  Don't use this phrase, ever ever when asking someone to get something done for you.  It is an insult to their intelligence.  Generally speaking if an employee requires this phrase to get things done in a timely manner then you are dealing with the wrong employee and you should consider firing them.

## A better way to get your way
So how should the situation be handled.  Just as with ASAP, you should simply be direct.  Instead of saying the sooner the better, the person requesting help should just ask if there is any way to get it done sooner.  Perhaps that employee asking for the favor should try offering some good will by phrasing the request in a more straightforward and sympathetic way.  For example, one could say, "Is there anyway you could get to it immediately? Lunch is on me if you can finish it before taking lunch."  You may not get your request met, but at least you are showing you understand that the world does not revolve around your timeline.  

That's all for this installment. Thanks for taking the time to read my second rant on language in the workplace.  I'm sure there are a number of ways you could get your way without using the phrase "the sooner the better".  Please leave a comment with how you would ask your co-worker to do you a favor.
