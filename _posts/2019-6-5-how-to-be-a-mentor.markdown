I use this blog to organize my thoughts about my professional work with the goal of perhaps helping others organize theirs if they find themselves in a similar position.  While much of my work is related to writing code and connecting the technology dots that business stakeholders rely on to improve customer outcomes, another large and growing part of my work is centered around mentorship.  This article will focus on the mentorship part of my life.  First I'll define what I believe the role of a mentor is in a technical setting (might be applicable outside of technical setting) and second this article will outline some lessons learned and tips acquired that may help you if you find yourself in the position of mentoring a colleague.

# The role of a mentor

In my opinion the role of a mentor is too provide the following guidance( in order of importance ):

1. Challenge the mentee's thought process without breaking their spirit or making them feel stupid for not considering the alternative points of view.
2. Offer recommendations and provide opportunities to learn new skills.
3. Bring the mentee back from the metaphorical cliff's edge just before they are about to jump (convince them not to quit).
4. Ask subject relevant questions that help the mentee consider 2nd and 3rd or effects of the choices they are making.

I hope those bullet points are self explanatory, but if they are not hopefully the rest of the article will offer more practical advice.

# Don't give them answer

Beginner mentor's often make the mistake of thinking they are a dictionary to be used as a way for mentee's to lookup the answer to a specifc question.  Don't make the mistake of acting like a far inferior version of google or stack-exchange.  First you will never keep pace with the vast knowledge the internet can provide so don't even try.  Second, even if you had a photographic memory you would be doing your mentee a dis-service by giving them the answer.

I firmly believe that giving someone the answer to the question is a form of *intellecutal theft*.  Robbing someone of the pride and joy of struggling through and ultimately solving a hard problem it antithetical to your role as Mentor.  Don't do it.


## what should you do instead

Guide them towards the answer by asking them questions they didn't think to ask.  For example a mentee may ask if it's worth writing a unit test for a specific piece of code slated for a production release.  You could respond by saying yes you always write unit tests, no exceptions.  The outcome is likely, that a test gets written and the mentee is slightly better at writing unit tests.  

By telling them yes and giving them the answer, you have actually done them a dis-service because they were not able to forge the neural pathway themselves by discoving *the why* on their own. If instead, you asked a question that explored what would happend if they didn't write a test for the code, typically, with guidance and discussion, the mentee will convince themselves of the idea and cement the reasoning required to forge the idea into a habbit and eventual practice.

Not giving the answer takes in immense amount of patience from both parties so it's important that both the mentor and the mentee understand the reasoning behind taking the long way around.

The movie inception is somewhat spot on with this concept in my opinion.  It's very hard to convince an individual of an idea.  It's often more effective to guide a person towards believing they had the idea all on their own.

# Be less available

It's tempting to think that always being their for your mentee at all hours of the day will provide them with the best, quickest path towards growth, and enlightenment.  However, I've found this to be completely untrue in practice.  If you are always their and available you run a very high risk of creating a co-dependent mentee where they are unable to complete work without your input.  This is un-healthy and ultimately won't serve to enrich the career of either party. 

## what should you do instead

If it's a simple question and your mentee is using you like a dictionary, I advise just ignoring them for a short period. An hour or so is usually sufficient, then follow up with them and ask if they still need help.  If they do, guide them with pointed questions and perhaps a link or to to some reference material you have handy. 

If the question is non-trival and involves more thought, encourage them to schedule something for the "following day" on your calendar. This will give them time to think about questions they want to ask and ponder possible solution and literally, sleep on it. This process of sleeping on it is really important.  What often ends up happening is that the meeting set up for the following day ends up taking the tone of an informed discussion, where the mentee is just verifying their already cohesive thoughts about the orignal question, rather than trying to answer the orignal question.

This process is valuable because it offers the mentor an opportunity to learn something from the mentee.  In general discussion is greater than lecture in the context the mentor to mentee relationship.


# Discuss your history

Mentor's often have more domain experience than mentee's.  Openly discussing this experience can provide some great direction for self guided learning. For example, if you have extensive experience with a particular technology.  Covering the pros and cons of lesson's learned while using that technology can be incredibly valuable to help focus an individual's selection in books or online courses that can enrich their learning. 

Be careful to not to impose too much of your bias on a particular topic.  Statements like, technology X doesn't do this so don't use it are less helpful than guiding mentee's towards the technology that would likely be adaquate. 

Adaquate is key here.  There may be 5 ways to solve a problem where each one is better than the next.  It's not always important that your mentee jumps right to the best solution but that they implement something that solves their problem and then reflect on what they could have done better.  As with so many things in life, learning is about the journey and not the destination as long as immediate needs are satisfied.  

*Be okay with imperfection but not negligence*


# Don't let them quit

Assuming they have chosen their career path and are pursuing some goal.  Don't let them quit when the going gets tough.  Ultimately much of success in this world comes down to grit.  How many cycles folks are willing to put into solving the problem makes a big difference in reaching a successful outcome.  

## what to suggest Instead of letting them quit

Try to reframe success in the form a smaller problem.  

For example if your mentee says they would like to create a nuclear fusion reactor in the next year with zero prior knowledge of what's involved, it's your job to lay out some first steps that will lead them ultimately to conclude that their original plan was unrealistic and they lacked the skills, while still keeping them on a productive path.  Instead you might suggest they take an elementary physics course and meet with some experts in the field.

Small wins will keep folks engaged and reduce the likelihood of a quitting and bring folks back from the brink of collapse.


Lastly, I have to give a shout-out to my current employer <a href="https://www.agero.com/">Agero</a>, while we don't yet have an official mentorship program, I've found that if you're a willing mentee there are a number folks in leadership positions that openly offer guidance and support.  In the cut-throat tech world this can be hard to find.

That's all I have for now.  If you are a mentor or mentee that wishes to share your experience please leave a comment.
