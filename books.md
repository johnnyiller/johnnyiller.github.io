# Books you may want to consider reading

Generally speaking, I love to read books.  Particularly I love to read books about Tech, Health, and Economics.  These are some of the books I've read with some notes for those interested.

## Technical

### [The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002)

If you read one book about how to deploy and run a software company at scale this should be it.

*Key points:*

1. Flow of code is important (ABM) always be merging to master
2. Test at the system level as well as the unit level
3. Work in progress is to be avoided (small frequent releases)
4. When the build breaks all developers have one responsiblity (get the build working)
5. Quality is not a department, it is a requirement
6. Monitor performance and errors so they can be addressed as part of normal dev cycle
7. You can't have agile project management without agile code release
8. Developers should have full control of early stage projects in production until they are stable

### [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby: An Agile Primer](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330)

Great book on object oriented design.  Especially useful for ruby developers as most of the examples use ruby.

*Key points:*

1. Developers can't know the future, therefore developers preserve flexibility in their code (good design allows isolation of changes)
2. Inversion of control and dependency injection help you swap components
3. Focus on the messages your objects send and receive
4. Strive for single responsiblity
